# Introduction

AU Manager is a fictitious microservice-based application created and utilized by Americas University (also, a fictitious company) to manage internal aspects of the company. This repository holds the source code of one of the microservices comprised by AUManager.

# AUManager - IAC (aumanager-iac)

This repository is part of the whole solution and does gather different approaches (CLI, Powershell, Terraform and more) on provisioning AUManager's core infrastructure to run on public cloud.

Please, be advised that each microservice has its own IAC resources. The ones reunited here refere to global infrastructure (Kubernetes Cluster, Web Apps Cluster, Network, so on so forth).
